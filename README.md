# Signal-Transmission-Analog-vs-Digital-Transmission
In this notebook we will explore the potential advantages of digital transmission over analog transmission. We will consider the case of transmission over a long (e.g. transoceanic) cable in which several repeaters are used to compensate for the attenuation introduced by the transmission.
